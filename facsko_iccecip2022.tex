\abstract{Gas pipelines, transmission lines, overhead wires, transformers, GNSS navigation, and telecommunication systems are part of critical infrastructure. Industry, transportation, service operations, farming, and everyday life highly depend on this infrastructure. However, these systems are very sensitive to solar activity. Therefore, all activities above are vulnerable and defenseless against the catastrophic changes in Earth’s cosmic environment.
  
  The Solar System is dominated by the influence of our star. In the Solar System, all objects are bounded gravitationally and the Sun’s radiation provides the energy par example for the terrestrial biosphere. A small fraction of the energy produced in the core of our star turns into a magnetic field and emits the constant high-velocity plasma flow, the solar wind. Solar magnetic activity produces radiation and ejects matter from the upper atmosphere of our star. The magnetic field frozen to the solar wind plasma interacts with the planetary magnetic fields and atmospheres. These phenomena, called Space Weather have a serious influence on the radiation environment of Earth where telecommunication, GNSS, meteorological, and other purpose satellites are located. The conductivity and transparency of the higher partly ionized atmospheric layer, the ionosphere also depend on solar radiation and activity. This fact makes the navigation and communication systems dependent on solar activity. Finally, the solar magnetic activity creates magnetic variations in the terrestrial magnetic field and induces currents in gas pipelines, transmission lines, overhead wires, and transformers.
  
In this short briefing, we introduce the solar activity phenomena, and their influence on our planet’s cosmic neighborhood and provide a detailed description of the Space Weather effects on critical infrastructure. Finally, we share and detail some methods to forecast the critical Space Weather effects and protect the infrastructure mentioned previously.}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This paper is supposed to be a brief review of the cosmic phenomena that endangers our planet and civilization on planet Earth. 

\subsection{Definitions and clarifications}
\label{sec:def}

Here, the critical infrastructure (CI) means submarine internet cables, gas pipelines, transmission lines, overhead wires, transformers, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) navigation, satellite telecommunication, and HF radio telecommunication systems. Submarine internet cables, gas pipelines, transmission lines, overhead wires, and transformers are long, conductive objects therefore they are sensitive to quickly varied magnetic fields. GNSS navigation, satellite telecommunication, and HF radio telecommunication systems depend on the transmission and reflection ability of the ionosphere (that is a conductive layer of the upper atmosphere at $\sim$120\,km altitude).

The Space Weather (SW) term has two meanings. It is a new(er) name for the research of the solar-terrestrial relationship. Additionally, the expression covers the efforts to predict the conditions of the near-Earth cosmic environment, the ionosphere, and the surface of our planet \cite{scherer05:_space_weath}.

\subsection{Introduction to space weather}
\label{sec:swintro}

The main drive of the space weather in the Solar System is the Sun. All planets, moons and other objects are located in its extended and expanding atmosphere, the solar wind. The solar wind interacts with the magnetic field of our star.

\subsubsection{The solar magnetic activity}
\label{sec:magnact}

We have an aggressive and dominant neighbor: the Sun (Fig.~\ref{fig:sunvisible}). During total solar eclipes the solar corona, this hot, extended and relatively faint part of the atmosphere of our star becomes visible. You can see filaments in the corona and its shape and extension varies depending the Sun's magnetic activity (Fig.~\ref{fig:sunvisible}, top left). In visible light you can see sunspot on the disc of the Sun (Fig.~\ref{fig:sunvisible}, top right). These regions have lower temperature than their neigbourhood therefore they look darker (Fig.~\ref{fig:sunspot}). In the wavelength of $H_{\alpha}$--line (656.28\,nm) the granulation, the continious boiling (or convective) motion of the solar plasma is visible (Fig.~\ref{fig:sunvisible}, bottom). The energy produced in the solar interiour leaves our star by conductivity in it outmost layer. This conductive motion of the conductive solar plasma and the rotation of the Sun set up and moves the solar dynamo that produces strong magnetic field. The magnetivity of our star dominates the space nearly the Sun. This region of the space is called heliosphere (Fig.~\ref{fig:corona}, bottom). The magnetic activity of the Sun makes serious disturbances in the navigation and the communication \cite{scherer05:_space_weath,stix04:_sun_introd}. 

Our star produces energy by thermonuclear fusion in its core. The produced energy flows out by radiation until $\sim$70\,\% of its radius. There the material of the Sun becomes convective. It means that the energy is transported by moving material and not by radiation. The Sun rotates quite quickly. The material of our star is in a so-called plasma state: its atoms lost their electrons and build up a quasi-neutral, highly conductive material. The convective and rotational motions of the highly conductive material set up a dynamo. Therefore the Sun has a very strong magnetic field. The magnitude of this magnetic field is 1\,Tesla (T). The magnitude of Earth's magnetic field is from 25000\,nT to 65000\,nT. In a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) instrument the strength of the magnetic field is $\sim$1\,T in a 0.5\,m$\times$0.5\,m$\times$0.5\,m cube. On the Sun the diameter of the magnetic flux tubes are $\sim$13000\,km (2\,$R_{Earth}$) and their length could be a few hundred thousand\,km. Those solar magnetic structures consist of a vast amount of energy. It is only $\sim$1\,\% of the energy produced by the fusion in the solar core. However, the magnetic field and the magnetic activity of the Sun have a dominant influence on the nearby space around the Sun, to the heliosphere \cite{scherer05:_space_weath,stix04:_sun_introd}.


\subsubsection{Flares and coronal mass ejections}
\label{sec:cme}

Sometimes two solar flux tubes with opposite direction situated close to each other and gradually forms an ``X'' shape configuration (Fig.~\ref{fig:reconnection}). If these flux tubes are enough close to each other it becomes energetically better configuraton if half-half of the opposite tubes form a shorter bended structure (Fig.~\ref{fig:reconnection}). Its phenomena is called reconnection and bursts huge amount of energy. This region of the solar atmosphere reaches 15-20\,million\,K degree. (The temperature of the arbitrary defined solar surface is 6000\,K and the solar core where the termonuclear fusion produces the energy is only 16\,million\,K degree.) A bright flash in vissible light, X-ray and radio bursts are ejected. Charged particles are accelerated to high energy, these are the Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs). A jet is ejected to the solar surface and usually (but not always) a huge amount of hot plasma launched to the heliosphere. Its name is coronal mass ejection (CME) or solar storm (Fig.~\ref{fig:cme}). The ejected plasma node remains connected magnetically to the Sun during its travel in the Solar System (Fig.~\ref{fig:cme}, bottom). CMEs can also occur independently. A large CME could contain a billion tons of plasma that can be accelerated to several thousand km per seconds. Solar material flies through the interplanetary medium, impacting any planet (Fig.~\ref{fig:cmeearth}) or spacecraft in its path \cite{scherer05:_space_weath,stix04:_sun_introd}.

\subsubsection{The solar wind and solar wind streams}
\label{sec:sw}

The reason for all troubles in the heliosphere is the atmosphere of the Sun (Fig.~\ref{fig:corona}, top left). The temperature of the photosphere is 6000\,K. The temperature of the chromosphere which is above the photosphere is around 10000\,K. Finally, the temperature of the corona which exists above the chromosphere is around 1000000\,K. You can see that in the solar atmosphere, the outer layers have higher temperatures (Fig.~\ref{fig:corona}, top left). A strong, fast plasma flow originates from the outer layer of the solar corona, the solar wind (Fig.~\ref{fig:cmeearth}). The distribution of the solar wind speed has two maxima at 400\,km/s and 800\,km/s \cite{mccomas98:_ulyss}. These types of the solar wind are called slow and fast solar wind or slow and fast solar wind streams. The slow solar wind originated from the normal solar coronal. In X$-$ray and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations, the solar corona has larger regions so-called coronal holes that look dark in these wavelengths (Fig.~\ref{fig:corona}, top right). The fast solar wind is ejected from these coronal holes \cite{scherer05:_space_weath,stix04:_sun_introd}. The magnetic field lines move together with the solar wind plasma. You can say the magnetic field lines are frozen in the solar wind plasma. The solar wind moves radially outward and the Sun rotates. Very soon, the angular speed of the plasma will be less than the angular speed of the solar rotation. Therefore, a spiral form of the magnetic field is created by these movements. Its name is Parker-spiral. The fast and slow solar wind streams interact with each other and form compressional and rarefaction regions (Fig.~\ref{fig:corona}, bottom). These regions (co$-$called corotating interaction regions, CIRs) could hit the terrestrial magnetosphere \cite{scherer05:_space_weath}. Their effects and disturbances are not as strong as the effects of a CME however they could cause serious problems for critical infrastructure. 

\subsubsection{The terrestrial magnetosphere, ionosphere and the aurora}
\label{sec:magn}

Our planet has a strong magnetic field that is tilted to the Ecliptic (the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun) and bipole (that means it looks like the magnetic field of a bar magnet). The region where this magnetic field dominates is called the magnetosphere (Fig.~\ref{fig:aurora}, top). The solar wind flows faster than the sound speed and the speed of the perpendicular magnetic waves (the Alfv{\'e}n speed). This flow grabs the magnetic field of the former solar plasma (the magnetic field is frozen into the solar wind plasma). This magnetic field cannot enter the magnetosphere. The information about the obstacle cannot propagate against the supersonic and super--Alfv{\'e} nice flow because its maximal propagation speed is the sound and Alfv{\'e}n--speed. Furthermore, the solar wind cannot hit the magnetosphere without any deceleration. Therefore, I shock, so-called bow shock forms before the magnetosphere (Fig.~\ref{fig:aurora}, top). The solar wind passes, slow down, its density and magnetic field magnitude increases, its temperature and entropy increase, becomes more turbulent, and flows around the magnetosphere. Additionally, the solar wind direction changes and flows around the terrestrial magnetosphere. The separation layer between the magnetosheath and the magnetosphere is called magnetopause (Fig.~\ref{fig:aurora}, top). The region between the bow shock and the magnetopause is called magnetosheath (Fig.~\ref{fig:aurora}, top). The night side of the magnetosphere (that is antisunward) is elongated and extended far beyond the lunar orbit. This region is called the tail (Fig.~\ref{fig:aurora}, top). The terrestrial tail situated according to the direction of the solar wind as a windsock \cite{scherer05:_space_weath,voeroes14:_winds_condit_ram_co_ram,shang20:_unusual_locat_geotail_magnet_near_lunar_orbit}. 

The solar wind enters the terrestrial magnetosphere and creates aurora and the radiation belts (Fig.~\ref{fig:aurora}, bottom left). The charger particles of the solar wind always enter the magnetosphere at the north and south magnetic poles of our planet. These regions are called cups (Fig.~\ref{fig:aurora}, top). These particles are trapped and rotate around the magnetic field; furthermore, the rotating high-energy particles also move along the magnetic field lines. When these particles approach a magnetic pole they bounce back. Therefore, the charged particles move between the magnetic poles. They also drift perpendicularly to this movement. If you add their location and speed you get a so-called ring current above the magnetic equator. The region of these charged particles is called radiation belts and Van Allen belts \cite{scherer05:_space_weath}. The ring current influences the magnetosphere of the Earth. The charged particles hit and excite the molecules and atoms of the atmosphere. These excited atoms eject visible (green) light (Fig.~\ref{fig:aurora}, bottom left). This light is called aurora \cite{scherer05:_space_weath}. The aurora activity is permanent under the aurora oval (Fig.~\ref{fig:aurora}, bottom right). The intensity of the aurora is proportional to the bandwidth of the radio communication through the ionosphere (Kjellmar~Oksavik, personal~communication).

On the boundary of Earth's upper, partially ionized, therefore conductive atmosphere (the ionosphere) and the lower magnetosphere, huge current systems are indicated \cite{juusola14:_statis_gumic_mhd}. These currents and the high-energy particles ejected by solar flares or accelerated CME shocks interact with the ionosphere and might change its transparency and reflectivity (Fig.~\ref{fig:sweffects}). Therefore, solar activity influences GNSS navigation, satellite, and HF radio telecommunication systems\cite{scherer05:_space_weath}. Both observation and simulation of the variations of the terrestrial magnetic field in this region of our planet are challenging \cite{facsko16:_one_earth}. However, using ground-based magnetometers it is quite easy to record and monitor magnetic disturbances. Based on the measurements of geomagnetic observatories located at high and lower altitudes, you could determine whether a CME or another phenomenon disturbed and caused strong magnetic variations in the magnetosphere \cite{scherer05:_space_weath}. Based on these results the auroral activity could be predicted and currents induced by the rapid variations of the magnetic field could be calculated. These currents are called geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) and their magnitude depends on the conductivity of the surface materials \cite{scherer05:_space_weath}. However, the rapidly variable magnetic field also generates currents in all long conductive objects; such as gas pipelines, electric transmission lines, train overhead wires, submarine internet cables, and transformers \cite{scherer05:_space_weath}. Therefore, solar activity might cause damage in this type of critical infrastructure (Fig.~\ref{fig:sweffects}).

\section{Space Weather effects on critical infrastructure}
\label{sec:sweci}

The space weather phenomena described in Section~\ref{sec:swintro} might have serious effects on the critical infrastructure defined in Section~\ref{sec:def}. The sources of the distubances (Fig.~\ref{fig:sweffects}, white ellipses) are the radiation outside of the Solar System (so-called cosmic rays), the SEPs (Section~\ref{sec:cme}), the radiation of solar flares (Section~\ref{sec:cme}), the solar flare radio bursts (Section~\ref{sec:cme}), the CMEs (Section~\ref{sec:cme}), and energetic particles from the radiation belts (Section~\ref{sec:magn}). These phenomena effect the ionosphere (Section~\ref{sec:magn}) and induces currents in the objects on Earth's surface (Fig.~\ref{fig:sweffects}, red rectangles). 

The ionosphere bounces back the high frequency (HF) waves. Without this bounding ability the HF radio broadcast and communications would not be possible on Earth. This capability could be modified and even destroyed by space weather phenomena (Section~\ref{sec:magn}). However, the radio communication is also possible through this layer (Section~\ref{sec:magn}). Therefore, the satellite communication and location determination using GNSS position system are possible. The transparency of the ionosphere could be decreased by the space weather phenomena. Hence, the satellite communication becomes problematic. The disturbed ionosphere could deviate the direction of the GNSS signals too. The name of this effect is scintilation and might cause errors in the navigation systems. Finally, the reception of radio waves could be disturbed (Fig.~\ref{fig:sweffects}, red rectangles).

The rapidly variable terrestrial magnetic field induces geoelectric fields and currents on Earth's surface (Fig.~\ref{fig:sweffects}, red rectangles). Furthermore, it creates geomagnetically induced currents in power systems, submarine cables, gas pipelines, and train overhead wires (Fig.~\ref{fig:sweffects}, red rectangles). This is a dangerous effect. This phenomenon could block or destroy communication and energy transfer; furthermore, it is unwelcome for gas transfer. These systems could be protected if we know the magnitude of the effects or switch them off if we could forecast the phenomena. 

Aurora is a beautiful tourist attraction and an important indicator of solar activity (Fig.~\ref{fig:sweffects}, red rectangles). Furthermore, the intensity of the aurora is proportional to the bandwidth of the radio communication through the ionosphere (Section~\ref{sec:magn}). The observation of the aurora is easy using optical full--sky cameras.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:sum}

The Sun dominates its neighborhood $\rightarrow$ The heliosphere is the region dominated by the Sun. The solar wind comes from the solar corona. It interacts with the objects in the heliosphere. The energy produced by fusion flows outward and creates magnetic activity. The magnetic field creates solar spots, protuberances, filaments, and flares. The magnetic reconnections produce an incredible amount of energy. In this flash, the flare ejects particles into interplanetary space and the solar atmosphere. The flash could reach 20 MK and launch a coronal mass ejection (CME). The CMEs are material ejections to the interplanetary space. Their size could be much larger than the diameter of the Sun. If the CMEs reach the Earth they could create magnetic disturbances, aurora, and geomagnetically induced currents in the pipelines. They may ruin the communication equipment and electronic devices in the orbit of the Earth. These events cut short-wave communication by changing the conductivity of the ionosphere however they can disturb satellite communication and navigation systems.

The aurora is the consequence of the phenomena above. The aurora activity is permanent under the aurora oval. The intensity of the aurora is proportional to the bandwidth of the radio communication through the ionosphere. These events can be predicted and the critical infrastructure can be prepared. The satellite systems can be switched off
before the solar storm arrives.

The space weather is the events described above and their prediction. It has a direct application. The USA, China, Brazil, South Africa, Sweden, the UK, and the ESA have space weather forecast centres.

(Bottom left) The aurora looks beautiful on the night skies of high altitudes. The human eyes can usually observe only the green light. (Bottom right) The solar wind enters the terrestrial magnetosphere and creates aurora. There is aurora in daylight too however you cannot see it. The aurora looks oval on the surface of the Earth around the north and south poles.

\caption{(White ellipses) Space weather is guided by the radiation from outside the Solar System (cosmic rays), solar energetic particles, solar flare radiation (for example X--rays), radiation from the Earth's radiation belts, and the coronal mass ejections. (Red rectangles) These disturbances cause navigation errors, enhanced ionospheric currents and disturbances, high-frequency radio communication disturbances, GNSS location problems, radio reception disturbances, aurora, and, geomagnetically induced currents in current systems, gas pipelines, and train overhead wires. (Red crosses) Those space weather effects are not considered in this paper.
